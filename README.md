## Notes
From NASA API docs
```text
In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used.
This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so youâ€™re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY are:

  Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
  Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day
```


# TODO
* Implement context logger
* Implement request tracing
* Implement a cache to avoid retrieving the same URLs multiple times
* Implement liveness and readiness probe
* Implement a hypothetical (PoC) mechanism to make calls to the mediadownloader service (gRPC?)
* Add tests
